### **Project Overview: Stock Price Prediction for HDFC Bank Using Historical Data**

This project focuses on predicting the future stock prices of HDFC Bank using historical Open price data. By leveraging machine learning techniques, 
specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks, the project aims to forecast future stock movements based on past trends. Below is a detailed breakdown of 
the project's components, methodologies, and outcomes.

---

#### **1. **Objective**
- **Goal:** To predict the future Open prices of HDFC Bank stock using historical Open price data.
- **Approach:** Utilize time series forecasting with an LSTM-based neural network model.

#### **2. **Data Collection and Preparation**
- **Data Source:** A CSV file containing historical OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) data for HDFC Bank.
  
  
  
- **Handling Missing Values:** Forward-fill method is applied to address any missing data points, ensuring data continuity.
  
- **Feature Selection:** The 'Open' price is selected as the primary feature for prediction.
  
 
  
- **Data Scaling:** Min-Max Scaler scales the Open prices to a range between 0 and 1, which is essential for optimizing the performance of the neural network.
  
 
#### **3. **Data Preparation for LSTM**
- **Sequence Creation:** The data is structured into sequences where each input (`x_stock`) consists of the Open prices from the past 30 days, and the corresponding output (`y_stock`) is the Open price of the next day.
  
  
  
- **Reshaping:** The input and output arrays are converted into NumPy arrays to be compatible with the LSTM model.
  

#### **4. **Model Development**
- **Model Architecture:** A Sequential LSTM model is constructed with the following layers:
  - **First LSTM Layer:** 50 units with `return_sequences=True` to pass the sequence to the next LSTM layer.
  - **Dropout Layer:** 20% dropout rate to prevent overfitting.
  - **Second LSTM Layer:** 20 units with `return_sequences=False` to output a single vector.
  - **Dense Layer:** 1 unit for the final prediction without an activation function, suitable for regression tasks.
  
  
  
- **Compilation:** The model uses the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001 and gradient clipping (`clipnorm=1.0`) to stabilize training.
- The loss function is Mean Squared Error (MSE), appropriate for regression.


#### **5. **Model Training**
- **Training Parameters:** The model is trained for 30 epochs with a batch size of 20.
  
- **Training Metrics:** The loss history is printed to monitor the model's performance over epochs.
 

#### **6. **Model Evaluation and Visualization**
- **Predictions:** The trained model predicts the Open prices based on the input sequences.
  
- **Inverse Scaling:** Both predicted and actual Open prices are transformed back to their original scale for meaningful comparison.
  
  
  
- **Visualization:** A plot is generated to compare the predicted Open prices against the actual values, providing a visual assessment of the model's accuracy.

#### **7. **Future Predictions**
- **Next Day Prediction:**
  - **Input Preparation:** The last 30 days of scaled Open prices are reshaped to fit the model's input requirements.
  
  - **Prediction:** The model predicts the Open price for the next day.
 

- **Next 10 Days Predictions:**
  - **Iterative Prediction:** The model predicts the next 10 days sequentially. After each prediction, the predicted value is appended to the input sequence to forecast subsequent days.
    
    
    
  - **Inverse Scaling and Display:** The predicted values are transformed back to the original scale and printed.

#### **8. **Key Insights and Considerations**
- **Model Choice:** LSTM networks are well-suited for time series data due to their ability to capture temporal dependencies, making them ideal for stock price prediction.
  
- **Data Window:** Using a 30-day window allows the model to consider a month's worth of historical data, capturing both short-term trends and patterns.
  
- **Normalization:** Scaling the data ensures that the model trains efficiently and reduces the risk of numerical instability.
  
- **Overfitting Prevention:** The use of Dropout layers helps mitigate overfitting, enhancing the model's generalization to unseen data.
  
- **Future Predictions:** Iterative forecasting (predicting multiple days ahead) can accumulate prediction errors. Strategies like retraining the model with newly predicted data or using ensemble methods might improve accuracy.


#### **10. **Conclusion**
This project successfully demonstrates the application of LSTM neural networks for forecasting stock prices using historical data.
While the model shows promise in predicting future Open prices, further enhancements and validations are recommended to improve its reliability and accuracy in real-world scenarios.
